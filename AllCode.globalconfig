# Severities for dotnet diagnostics:
#   error      - Violations appear as build errors and cause builds to fail.
#   warning    - Violations appear as build warnings but do not cause builds to fail (unless you have an option set to
#                treat warnings as errors).
#   suggestion - Violations appear as build messages and as suggestions in the Visual Studio IDE.
#                PEARL: no, they do not appear as build messages. Only as suggestions in the IDE.
#   silent     - Violations aren't visible to the user.
#                PEARL: this is not the whole truth: violations are not visible, but fixes are available.
#   none       - Rule is suppressed completely.
#                PEARL: what they really mean is: violations are not visible, and fixes are not available either.
#   default    - The default severity of the rule is used. The default severities for each .NET release are listed in
#                the roslyn-analyzers repo. In that table, "Disabled" corresponds to none, "Hidden" corresponds to

dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0008.severity = warning
# Justification: Here is a rule worth living by:
#    "Any choice that makes code easier to read is preferable over any choice that makes code easier to write".
#    The use of `var` makes code easier to write, but not easier to read, because it often leaves the reader wondering
#    what is the exact type hidden by `var`.
#    Script kiddies might object that on the contrary, explicitly stating the type makes code harder to read, because
#        there is extra stuff to read, and the extra stuff is unimportant. Script kiddies say this because types are
#        just unnecessary noise to them. Script kiddies can go get a life.
#    Therefore, never use `var` unless the type is obvious.
#    The type is obvious only in the following cases:
#      - when assigning a literal of a built-in type. (e.g. `var a = "covfefe";`, `var a = 42;`, `var a = 5.0;`)
#        (although there is very little to be gained by saying `var a = 5.0;` vs. `double a = 5.0;`
#      - when assigning the result of `new`. (e.g. `var a = new Foo();`)
#      - when assigning the result of a type-cast. (e.g. `var a = (int)b;`)
#    In all other cases, feel free to momentarily use `var` when declaring a variable, and then immediately ask the IDE
#        to refactor that `var` into the actual type.

dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0010.severity = silent
# PEARL: Normally, we would want to have this rule; however, it triggers on pattern-matching switches where it really

#        contains nothing but a break. So, if we were to have this rule enabled, we would be forced to also have
#        redundant default clauses all over the place.
# TODO:  Consider enabling this rule and going through the trouble of adding default clauses in all switch statements in
#        the entire solution, if doing so would allow us to use the absence of a default clause as an indication that we
#        expect the case clauses to be exhaustive and to receive a warning if a case clause is missing.

# IDE0011: "Add braces"
# PEARL: This rule is stupendously biased. Not only its name reflects a specific choice of `true`, but also, the only
#        choice that actually works is `true`.  The `false` choice does absolutely nothing, while the `when_multiline`
#        choice does something bizarre: it requires the `then` part of an `if` statement to have braces if the `else`
#        part is multi-line and vice versa. (Go figure.)
# PEARL: Since "Add braces" configured to `false` does not work, and since there is no "Remove braces" rule, we 
#        cannot have a warning issued when some cargo-cult programmer litters our code-base with redundant curly braces.

#    If it is unclear to you what the language defaults are, then go learn the language _fully_ and come back

#    Additionally, there is merit in never specifying the accessibility of private methods because while

# PEARL: This rule is not content with the native methods being declared as internal in a static internal class;

# PEARL: Visual Studio has a ridiculous bug where the debugger shows the wrong class if there are multiple classes with

dotnet_diagnostic.CA1062.severity = none
# Justification: This rule has largely been rendered obsolete since explicit nullability was introduced to the language.
#    Essentially, with explict nullability in place, this rule is telling us to check arguments against null in case

dotnet_diagnostic.CA1721.severity = none
# Justification: It is perfectly fine to have a property named `Something` and a method named `GetSomething`, as long
#    as the method returns the exact same thing that the property returns. This is done, for example:
#      - For convenience, since a method can be passed as-is where a delegate is expected, whereas a property cannot, 
#        so a new lambda has to be created just in order to access the property.
#      - As a workaround to the problem that an abstract get-only property cannot be overridden with a property that

#         a.k.a. "Change <class>.Dispose() to call GC.SuppressFinalize(object). This will prevent [bla bla...]"
# PEARL: When a Dispose() method is flagged by this rule, what it usually means is that the containing class should
